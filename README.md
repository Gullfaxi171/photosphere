Photo sphere with three.js
===========================

Forked from Bjorn Sandvik work : <a href="http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2014/01/photo-spheres-with-threejs.html">this blog post</a>.


Added by Florent Gros :
* Buttons to switch between photospheres, menu
* Some photospheres
* Stopping rotation while clicking
* Restarting rotation 5 secs after releasing the mouse
* Less deformations with a more meshes (but need better computer)
* Autoresize the scope when resizing the window
* Better controls on phones

To come :
