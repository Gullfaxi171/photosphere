Photo sphere with three.js
===========================

Forked from Bjorn Sandvik work : <a href="http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2014/01/photo-spheres-with-threejs.html">this blog post</a>.


Added by Florent Gros :
* Buttons to switch between photospheres
* Some photospheres
* Stopping rotation while clicking
* Restarting rotation 5 secs after releasing the mouse
* Less deformations with a more meshes (but need better computer)

To come :
* LeapMotion control
* Headtracking control with webcam
* Better controls on phones
